# 🌊 ProjectPool

**ProjectPool** is a platform built to simplify and streamline the **final-year project selection process** for students and faculty.

Every student knows the struggle:

- ❌ Multiple teams fighting for the same project  
- ❌ Endless manual approvals  
- ❌ Zero clarity on who gets what  
- ❌ Confusion and wasted time  

**ProjectPool** eliminates all that by introducing a **fair, transparent, and efficient system** that ensures every project gets assigned without conflict or chaos.

## ✨ Version 1 Highlights

- ✅ **Team Formation Made Simple** – Students can easily form teams and select from available projects.  
- ✅ **Instant Approvals** – Admins can approve or reject project requests in seconds.  
- ✅ **No Conflicts** – One Team = One Project → ensuring clarity and fairness.  
- ✅ **Faster Workflow** – Smooth, automated project allocation for everyone involved.

## 🌟 What’s Coming in Version 2

- 💡 **Faculty Project Proposals** – Faculty members can propose up to four projects directly into the pool.  
- 💡 **Faculty Directory** – A complete list of department faculty available within the platform.  
- 💡 **Group Change Requests** – Students can request group changes with approval from teammates and supervisors.  
- 💡 **New Roles** – Introducing a dedicated *Faculty* role alongside *Admin* and *Student*.
